# VÃ©lÃ”Toulouse

ğŸšµ a small **non official** web app to get real time bikes availability in Toulouse based on JCDecaux api

Since this app is using JCDecaux API, you should be able to fork this repo and publish it for [one of those cities](https://developer.jcdecaux.com/#/gbfs?page=usage) by changing the contract name in [here](/src/lib/fetch.ts) and changing default location in [here](/src/components/vt/Bikes.vue).

> VÃ©lÃ”Toulouse is a PWA so you can add it to your home screen and get a greater ux.
