# VelosToulouse

ðŸšµ a small web app to get real time bikes availability based on JCDecaux api

> VelosToulouse is a PWA so you can add it to your home screen and get a greater ux.

Since this app is using JCDecaux API, you should be able to fork it and publish it for [one of those cities](https://developer.jcdecaux.com/#/gbfs?page=usage) by changing the contract name in [here](/src/lib/fetch.ts) and changing default location in [here](/src/components/vt/Bikes.vue).
